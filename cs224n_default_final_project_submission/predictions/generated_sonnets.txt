Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
Be that yourself that I forgot
To myself render the line usury to praise:
Alas! Love's tongue tells and loving words bear;
O, budge then thee confute man's will,
Doth abide in the madding mark.
Since, born folly with thee doth gladly put part,
Doth uphold vice in the heart and knows
His place until marriage consummeth,
Whilst, as thou wilt with her all diseased view,
They estimate his wealth to be four millions rich.
  Though those vow seldom rhyme, poor, and rich,

Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
And urge thine greatest perfumes towards old age?
Thou mightst not mak account to rest having doth so shift
As few lovely beauty lovers before made,
Under false mixed health; nor thy health so youthful must it seem,
Returning youth and breast nourish,
For thee thus in fable fears the unknown
Shall set private beauty in history,
Thy silken breast remaining after decease must make a new friend.
  Then I find a point against more youthful loan
  At every rite crime against thee bold against decay.
  Yet do no resort to envy of

My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Nor furs which live from tears nor deaths change.
But nature hath nourished immoderate figures,
Whose numbers created a tyrannical power
That with hind of drawn soil once men stopped doth hang.
Nature 'a strong soil possessed of traps and captains
And each to account good or bad gave his own;
And when unalloyed thought preyed on a fairer shade,
Supposing any guest acquainted of addition's kind
To think of anything better to be had,
O, surely of my most sweet sweet self vaunt'd,
And beggar what would lose my trouble


3
O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
That truth alone may write, and my head as well,
As wearest boldy compounded words which are true,
Or with lies forbear for many shows.
Muse but most those voices strong for my picture,
Which drown my salutation, let no sound
Save frown show on my worth either in time.
  And then haply life thanks hath painted
  More painted no color to speak and pertained heaven's.
  For man must strive of all their vulgar books
  To teach of the world and men his truths.


4
Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot your sight?
So sweet
Thou so gentle and so lovely, that it would have most repulsive strife
Had I for thy quality lacked that effect
Of mind wherein I could tell thou wilt tread
Sweet grace would kindle some feeble object.
He would cut off thy rhyme
Because he knew thou mightst outstripping him
Attracting no praise but thanks be' mine,
For sweetissed quick things, they can steal things from me.
  Yet thou answered despite of my words,
  For thy praise to me transgressed eternity,
  So painful for myself


5
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
Unless ever thou thyself merit,
Why couldst thou no morn when pride shapes thee?
By age he grows dull from wanton haste,
And daily after learning something dearer,
Nor answers my pencil by answers heeth from sonne.
But give I hope to old men, for not let them
Doubting me now grew idle scion,
To shiver errands blotted out of him,
And scolding his youth by misapprehensions:
  Give of all this simplicity my dear love,
  Till, losing love from lack, thou best come again.


6
Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
After it sin against thy might, slow what hand hath sweet thy cheek.
Pity, sweet show, thy love lies reclusive,
That oft birds sang as sweet music
To the shoreless ocean, or dost, when their cry was hoarse,
Adrift or fortune's head bowed heart,
And blood spurted like beheaded birds back from their foul doom.
She hath but painted eyes,
Her vulgarism's ornament best visage;
With black uprest thou ten betwixt figures
Like this painted, none more thy spite
Nor ornament will bear others spite's see!



7
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn
Against me hope might unhear.
Though thy advocate bear thy path, I approve
The loss which thou beest, though thou leave the aching paws,
Or his lover's doom meet at a tenth full year.
But now this I consider!
All holy prophets of thee in this age hold
Upon these fears wondrous marks,
How bitter that many faults some thousand fill,
Against him yet beguiled truly bebate.
   They love orphans while addily sell itself,
  Half heartily nature's downfall overturns us.

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steepen her wreaths
For lies in the barren region of different
The plumage of a dove's flail,
Making her white'ring able for breath with ishot,
And then 'littering under me, where my wanton hot hounds night
Bring us men's sweet supponents dressed with change;
Spending on no straight pleasing common part,
My eye tender tenderly slept, and made her green;
  Preserving her ranks in flesh and everywhere contracted,
  She fell ill with another; up rich, gives rotten bestowals.


9
The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,
Yet his frailties fell on others wailing;
He rose not thus before winter's infection,
Whilst at home to the neighbours of the ear,
Though summer rest also on hair plumed.
The well seems to blame to him alone who deemed wise,
The bereaved that he played last
Nor helped by acquaintance but one of his ghastly drotches.
Now these reasons have brought me some garments that will comfort,
Than garments worse than she knew them themselves.
  Love bears sweet praise of stores and others,
  Is too full of fat if given


10
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Or confined hapless noble even confined his neck.
Hear not thy jealous bell; heed not her jealous foetus,
Or those quacktack lies confined my heart,
Hearing hence impart their jest of their own stilth;
Or dull phrases of theirs heeding; lest I
Daunt virtue and disgraces my answer with slander.
So say I despite hate of thee his sooth,
 And yet thou have shied me from religious praise.
  Unless his anger gentle taste doth base favor,
  Or hope to brief it so by  near unbounded blasphemy.


11
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
Now that ignorance shall have him mistaken,
For let him die minutes think dumb,
And thou must live even so, neither salute in flowers to us,
Or ever losing lip in largess.
Then what fell then of love to do it
Making his spite there die?
For I was a lover of love of morn
Respected whether sin could live, or decay;
Yet eternal life is wise, and thou hast eternal freedom;
  Thus being born to love does thee leave eternal stupor,
  Where truth remains dear, so dear decay to our steal;
  Were it
