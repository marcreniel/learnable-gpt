Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
Disguising thy heart for mourning and dulling
Thyself with light and looking on others faint.
My brethren's tones, even they, in sadness
Have sullied thy sweet countenance;
And mine own sorrow is such a whit
As this, all my parts expressing it,
That self-love's beauty becomes my shame.
I tell what has happened and wail
And often beseech thee forbear; still
O, him thy heart for a woe doth shun
And thine for a sorrow denied her name.
  She's hard and cruel; thou art


1
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
With this bad wretch at my ease swooning,
To kill his pride, this sickly tyrant,
That thou need'st to drag all my pain,
To look on my disorder, like a jealous mother,
To poke behind each broken line on each strong frame,
Being strong enough to bear his ill spite,
Being strong enough to entertain his spite?
Be good enough to hold him up when he falls,
Hold him up bravely even to the rack,
Though it were the end of me for his pain;
Hold him up till his grief be so great that he dies,


2
So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
And thy may, true, may with crime subdue.
Bountiful leave have I had to dispraise him,
And choose what may best appear my crime;
Were it sin, then to choose, for sin's sake doth plead,
And this the public trials prove;
But so to confute him, then my word is proved
To sell myself by admitting of his lie.
  I never will, knowing true that I say,
  A stranger better hath to me than he from thee.


3
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
Since those bright eyes that glint in the noon
By thou how often doth this sin stain my fame;
More than enough then this heavy guilt demands,
Unless thou stout duty, though weak to bear,
Seek the perfidious among men and break
The appearance of my sweet name.
Then, patient, may I wait thy calling till thou
Bids me repay for this service I did thee,
The greater as well as before granted.
  Then shall I confess, bewailed in my heart
  That thou art both my scout and my fair crime;
  And thou with this


4
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
But till that, to swear thou in me must go,
To prove that 'twixt thy being and myself
Thou hast pleasure to touch alone.
In thee dost thought dwell, and ink thy word;
In me dost thine own part of use;
Thou art satisfied with some part of me,
And dost live when I neither praise nor sleep.
Happy art thou whose life thy wit delights to add,
Who to thy sweet violation takes upon thee
To do a thing untrue which so dear doth spring;
  To grudge of thy self thy due sweet pride


5
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
And feel that it is beauteous to stick
In saucy pinches and cavils of ribaldry;
Since they view things in their proper light,
Such as those famous poets tell,
And tell a damned ill tale theire fingers know,
Hang on to niggardries devised long ago.
Nay, all this lusty salve is their pride,
Just an ill measuring satin to make them green,
Stealing from virtue a very thin one.
  Give them appetite to see, if thou wilt:
  But not just enough to see they


6
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Roughing on unknown countries or mountains,
Whence I got that name by birth as old
As her face or as to her name depends.
I never seen or felt such thing put in simple words
As tell in her pure gold tongue all in rhyme;
Her living tongue is air warmed from the sun.
My love though wisdom doth teach doth not even count part
To teach, being all acquainted with truth;
But this enigmatically twain twain twain
Sings 'tis true thou hast sweet love's picture in truth.
  Love smiles not upon world's defects


7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Feed on my offenses, but in pardon entreat
My love; lend not myself, nor when I plead prove
To thee the penitent sinner that is my frame.
I will die to ransom thee; free me from this
Which for thy sake I bring upon myself,
From losses wherein thou hast received a prey.
So then, loving one only, pardon me,
And scold not thy sweet forbearing heart,
When willingly or unwillingly I trespass,
Making restitution to what thou worth'st to me.
  Then, beauteous paradise, sweet country of pleas



8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
Some sorrow hidden deep within my breast.
Too mine unkind words have dragged me there,
With broad-bent cheek, when thou art besmeared in snow.
O, what mischievous communication have I had
To corrupt the sweet time in my tongue,
That this waiting thought in your breasts have alarmed
To wrong each other's conversation with sighs and groans!
Have we said sweet things to one another in sighs,
Too proud of our fine accents to think clearly
What we said? Look what slander to modesty still bears,
Creeping over backward on our tongue's slow journey


9
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
And by it is my mind'd wailing heard,
Which tells truth not only in accents borrowed,
But numbers their own errors by more conjectures.
Though not therefore mine own thoughts, being wild,
All utterance of mine own heart to speech do debate
Though produced by subtler manufacture,
Still in mark of love's compliments frame
My looks with a semblance of his inward feeling.
  Yet this loving similitude lacks to thee
  The juiciness that doth my thoughts naturally belong.


10
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
The great conquest of thine affections,
Mine own fair done quite openly towards men!
For of these they gather thine approbation,
And all warm due let to this thy goodness claim,
As of thine own being holy methinks.
For this thy merit and thy use are just,
As reason says ever after in laws;
And profit there is no reproof but by praise,
  Convening us how far right goes in us.


11
Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
Of her stay; so, like a kennel master,
Upon that babe my cord went fast.
His sweet tooth the wound was too keen to kill,
And biting through the gape thy leaves hastened,
Waning now from his peace and now from his life;
His life had a steeple timbers and a steeple bark,
The stroke of the sharp fork at least;
Since, graciously delivered from thee, he stood
In dying poverty, having therein twice sold;
  And in dying he gave his rich wife back again,
  By gentle command repaying thy kindness
